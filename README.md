# slicc-agent

SLICC's agent core, built on pi's [durable](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/tree/main/packages/durable) harness. It runs in a dedicated worker next to [slicc-kernel](https://github.com/ai-ecoverse/slicc-kernel) and is shown by [slicc-spectrum](https://github.com/ai-ecoverse/slicc-spectrum). The plan is in [ai-ecoverse/slicc-agent#2](https://github.com/ai-ecoverse/slicc-agent/issues/2).

The package ships unbundled ESM: `dist/` holds one file per source file and imports pi's packages by name, so [slicc-bios](https://github.com/ai-ecoverse/slicc-bios) installs it from its lockfile like any other package, and `pnpm upgrade @ai-ecoverse/slicc-agent` updates it in place.

## Use

In the agent's dedicated worker:

```js
import { hostAgent, openAgent, openOpfsSqliteStorage, serveConnections } from '@ai-ecoverse/slicc-agent';

const storage = await openOpfsSqliteStorage();
serveConnections(self, openAgent({ models, model, storage }).then((agent) => hostAgent(agent)));
```

In the page:

```js
import { startAgent } from '@ai-ecoverse/slicc-agent';

const owner = await startAgent({ worker: () => new Worker(workerUrl, { type: 'module' }) });
const agent = await owner.connect();
agent.transcript.subscribe((view) => render(view));
await agent.prompt('What is in /home?');
```

- `openAgent({ models, model, storage?, registry?, settings? })` opens a durable Harness (in memory unless `storage` is given) and its root conversation, and resumes work a previous worker left unfinished.
- `openOpfsSqliteStorage({ directory?, file? })` keeps the session in wasm SQLite ([`@sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm)) in an `opfs-sahpool` pool, by default `/.slicc/agent/` in OPFS. It needs a dedicated worker. Only one worker holds a pool at a time: the opener takes a Web Lock per directory and waits until every file of the pool can be opened before sqlite-wasm installs it, because a failed install deletes the pool's directory. `openMemorySqliteStorage()` keeps the same database in memory.
- `hostAgent(agent)` serves the agent with pi's protocol: a pi-server with one session, `agent`, whose Chord services are `slicc.agent.control` (send with `whenBusy` `steer`, `followUp` or `reject`, wait, withdraw, abort, compact) and `slicc.agent.transcript` (the conversation's durable view as replicated state). `serveConnections(self, host)` hands it every `MessagePort` the page sends.
- `startAgent({ worker })` takes the Web Lock `slicc-agent`, so one tab at a time owns the agent worker, and waits while another tab holds it. `connect()` returns an `AgentConnection` (`control`, `transcript`, `prompt()`), `restart()` replaces the worker (durable resumes from SQLite), and `release()` stops it and lets the next tab take over.

### Bash and files on slicc-kernel

The page owns the one kernel (plan decision D3), and the agent worker attaches to it as a second client ([slicc-kernel#66](https://github.com/ai-ecoverse/slicc-kernel/issues/66)), so a terminal's `ps` and `kill` reach whatever the agent started.

```js
const owner = await startAgent({ worker, kernel: { connect: () => kernel.connect() } });
```

```js
import { attachKernel } from '@ai-ecoverse/slicc-kernel';
import { CodingTools } from '@earendil-works/pi-durable/tools';
import { kernelEnvironment, kernelPort } from '@ai-ecoverse/slicc-agent';

const client = await attachKernel(await kernelPort(self));
registry.install(CodingTools);
const agent = await openAgent({ models, model, storage, registry, env: kernelEnvironment(client) });
```

`SliccKernelEnv` implements pi durable's `ExecutionEnv` on the kernel client and passes pi's environment conformance suite:
- string commands run as `bash -c`, each in its own process group; timeouts and aborts kill the group;
- output past the spill limits goes to `/tmp/slicc-agent-output-*.log`;
- files and directories go through the kernel's OPFS view and metadata sidecar;
- `watch()` polls until the kernel offers file watching.

A conversation without a `cwd` works in `/home`.

### The worker seven starts

`@ai-ecoverse/slicc-agent/agent-worker` is a complete agent worker. It waits for the page kernel's port, then:
- attaches to the kernel and routes its cross-origin `fetch` through the kernel's transport when that transport isn't bound by CORS (slicc-node, slicc-swift or slicc-extension);
- opens the encrypted credential store, the AWS Bedrock provider and the session in OPFS SQLite;
- installs durable's coding tools and SLICC's system prompt, and serves the agent.

```js
const owner = await startAgent({
  worker: () => new Worker(new URL('@ai-ecoverse/slicc-agent/agent-worker', import.meta.url), { type: 'module' }),
  kernel: { connect: () => kernel.connect() },
});
```

`runAgentWorker(self, options)` is the same with its parts replaceable (model, providers, kernel attach, credentials, storage).

**Providers.** The first provider is AWS Bedrock with a Bedrock API key as the bearer token; the default model is `us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-5-5`. Requests go to `us-west-2` unless the stored credential names another region (`AWS_REGION`, set by `connect`'s `region`). The default applies when the credential is read, so keys stored earlier get it too. The settings UI has no region field yet. Bedrock sends no CORS headers, so it needs a CORS-free transport, and its account says so (`needs: 'cors-free-transport'`).

**Credentials.** They live in the IndexedDB database `slicc-agent-credentials`, sealed with AES-GCM under a non-extractable key that never leaves WebCrypto. They never enter the session database or the transcript, and followers never see them.

**Settings.** The `slicc.agent.settings` service shows the models and accounts and takes `connect(providerId, apiKey)` and `disconnect(providerId)`.

### In slicc-spectrum

`@ai-ecoverse/slicc-agent/spectrum` turns an `AgentConnection` into slicc-spectrum's `AgentPort`, so `<slicc-app>` shows the real agent:

```js
import { createAgentModel } from '@ai-ecoverse/slicc-agent/spectrum';

const agent = await owner.connect();
app.model = { ...createKernelModel({ kernel, root }), ...createAgentModel(agent, { storage: localStorage }) };
```

`createAgentModel()` returns the `agent` and `settings` ports. Settings keeps the UI preferences in `storage`; model and thinking belong to the conversation, and accounts and models come from the worker.

The adapter keeps the replicated transcript and maps it on every update. User, assistant and compaction entries become messages; tool results fill in the tool calls they answer; the generation in flight shows as a streaming message; retries and running compactions show as system messages. `busy()` and `queue()` read durable's live and inbox documents. A plain send queues a follow-up, and a steer send steers, as slicc-spectrum's composer asks today. There is one cone so far; scoops, the freezer, licks and questions come later. slicc-spectrum is a peer dependency (≥ 1.7.0) used for types only.

## Patched dependencies

Fixes to pi stay in this repository. [`patches/patches.json`](patches/patches.json) lists each one with its `kind`, `package`, `patchedVersion`, `reason`, `removeWhen` and `verify` command, and an optional `marker` (a file in the package and a string it must contain):

- `monkeypatch`: code that runs in users' browsers is patched at runtime. `applyPatches()` in [`src/patches.ts`](src/patches.ts) applies them once before pi is used: `PortListener.start()` calls it, so `hostAgent` and a `PortListener` used directly with pi's `Server` both get them. Each one checks that the code it replaces still looks as expected and throws, naming its manifest entry, if not. Today there is one: pi-server's `Server.accept` calls `unref()` on its handshake timer, which browsers don't have, so the patch gives numeric timer ids a no-op `unref`.
- `patch-package`: repository-only fixes go in `patches/<package>+<version>.patch`, applied by a `postinstall` that runs [patch-package](https://github.com/ds300/patch-package). There are none yet.
- `environment`: something the host must provide. pi-server imports `randomUUID` from `node:crypto`; slicc-bios serves a stub backed by `globalThis.crypto`, and the integration bundles alias it to `test/integration/shims/node-crypto.js`.

`npm run lint:patches` (part of `npm run lint`) fails when an installed version differs from `patchedVersion`, a marker is gone, a monkeypatch isn't named in `src/patches.ts`, a patch file and its entry don't match, or `renovate.json` doesn't route the package to the `patched dependencies` group with automerge off. That group covers every `@earendil-works/*` package, so a pi bump is always a reviewed PR: rerun each entry's `verify`, then move `patchedVersion` forward or drop the entry.

## Develop

```sh
npm install
npm run build
npm run test:unit
npm test
npm run lint
```

`npm test` builds `dist/`, bundles a test worker that runs the agent on pi's faux provider, and runs the integration tests in Chromium through the [slicc-shared-web harness](https://github.com/ai-ecoverse/slicc-shared-web#integration-test-harness). Unit tests live in `test/unit/`, which stays out of git; the pre-commit hook requires every changed line in `src/` to be covered. No test calls a real model.
