# slicc-agent

SLICC's agent core, built on pi's [durable](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/tree/main/packages/durable) harness. It runs in a dedicated worker next to [slicc-kernel](https://github.com/ai-ecoverse/slicc-kernel) and is shown by [slicc-spectrum](https://github.com/ai-ecoverse/slicc-spectrum). The plan is in [ai-ecoverse/slicc-agent#2](https://github.com/ai-ecoverse/slicc-agent/issues/2).

The package ships unbundled ESM: `dist/` holds one file per source file and imports pi's packages by name, so [slicc-bios](https://github.com/ai-ecoverse/slicc-bios) installs it from its lockfile like any other package, and `pnpm upgrade @ai-ecoverse/slicc-agent` updates it in place.

## Use

In the agent's dedicated worker:

```js
import { hostAgent, openAgent, openOpfsSqliteStorage, serveConnections } from '@ai-ecoverse/slicc-agent';

const storage = await openOpfsSqliteStorage();
serveConnections(self, openAgent({ models, model, storage }).then((agent) => hostAgent(agent)));
```

In the page:

```js
import { startAgent } from '@ai-ecoverse/slicc-agent';

const owner = await startAgent({ worker: () => new Worker(workerUrl, { type: 'module' }) });
const agent = await owner.connect();
agent.transcript.subscribe((view) => render(view));
await agent.prompt('What is in /home?');
```

- `openAgent({ models, model, storage?, registry?, settings? })` opens a durable Harness (in memory unless `storage` is given) and its root conversation, and resumes work a previous worker left unfinished.
- `openOpfsSqliteStorage({ directory?, file? })` keeps the session in wasm SQLite ([`@sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm)) in an `opfs-sahpool` pool, by default `/.slicc/agent/` in OPFS. It needs a dedicated worker. Only one worker holds a pool at a time: the opener takes a Web Lock per directory and waits until every file of the pool can be opened before sqlite-wasm installs it, because a failed install deletes the pool's directory. `openMemorySqliteStorage()` keeps the same database in memory.
- `hostAgent(agent)` serves the agent with pi's protocol: a pi-server with one session, `agent`, whose Chord services are `slicc.agent.control` (send with `whenBusy` `steer`, `followUp` or `reject`, wait, withdraw, abort, compact) and `slicc.agent.transcript` (the conversation's durable view as replicated state). `serveConnections(self, host)` hands it every `MessagePort` the page sends.
- `startAgent({ worker })` takes the Web Lock `slicc-agent`, so one tab at a time owns the agent worker, and waits while another tab holds it. `connect()` returns an `AgentConnection` (`control`, `transcript`, `prompt()`), `restart()` replaces the worker (durable resumes from SQLite), and `release()` stops it and lets the next tab take over.

### In slicc-spectrum

`@ai-ecoverse/slicc-agent/spectrum` turns an `AgentConnection` into slicc-spectrum's `AgentPort`, so `<slicc-app>` shows the real agent:

```js
import { createAgentModel } from '@ai-ecoverse/slicc-agent/spectrum';

const agent = await owner.connect();
app.model = { ...createKernelModel({ kernel, root }), ...createAgentModel(agent) };
```

The adapter keeps the replicated transcript and maps it on every update. User, assistant and compaction entries become messages; tool results fill in the tool calls they answer; the generation in flight shows as a streaming message; retries and running compactions show as system messages. `busy()` and `queue()` read durable's live and inbox documents. A plain send queues a follow-up, and a steer send steers, as slicc-spectrum's composer asks today. There is one cone so far; scoops, the freezer, licks and questions come later. slicc-spectrum is a peer dependency (≥ 1.7.0) used for types only.

pi-server 1.0.4 calls `unref()` on a `setTimeout` handle when it accepts a connection, which browsers don't have. `PortListener` wraps that one call so its timers get a no-op `unref`.

## Develop

```sh
npm install
npm run build
npm run test:unit
npm test
npm run lint
```

`npm test` builds `dist/`, bundles a test worker that runs the agent on pi's faux provider, and runs the integration tests in Chromium through the [slicc-shared-web harness](https://github.com/ai-ecoverse/slicc-shared-web#integration-test-harness). Unit tests live in `test/unit/`, which stays out of git; the pre-commit hook requires every changed line in `src/` to be covered. No test calls a real model.
